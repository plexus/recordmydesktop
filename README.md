Fork of the seemingly unmaintained RecordMyDesktop application.

If you need Jack support you will need this version, the last release (from 2010) is no longer compatible with the latest versions of Jack.

This fork contains this patch: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=588260

Plus one other commit to fix Jack support.

Based on the SVN trunk@602
